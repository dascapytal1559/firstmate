# Firstmate, as it changes

A working journal of the captain's Firstmate fork: what changed in how the ship runs, in the captain's words where he gave them, with the evidence from each round.
It is added to as the work goes.

## 1. The handoff gets fast, and stays careful (29 October 2026)

The question that started it:

A read-only design pass timed the path from a worker's `done` line to the main being woken at 45 to 48 seconds.
Almost all of it was two waits: a fixed 30 second linger in the watcher, and a supervision-host engine turn that, for a finished worker, always handed the wake back to the main anyway.

He asked that the linger's author be read carefully before anything was removed:

> we would want to really try to understand the intention of the author because he designs things very carefully

The linger exists so that a worker's final status write and the same turn's turn-end hook, which land seconds apart, cost one main turn rather than two.
A second scout checked whether that trailing turn-end could ever carry a problem.
It cannot: it is an empty file whose only content is its timestamp, and a turn that fails never touches it.
But one real case in this home's own logs would have been hidden by a blind absorb: a worker that took on follow-up work after its `done`, whose only sign of finishing was that turn-end.

The principle he set:

> I think the optimal design here would be if something is over the line, like 80% of the time let's say then we do we there is a good enough argument to start taking action at that point but then there must be the ability for us to recover if the second event is also consequential. And if we can do both of these things, I would say we've strictly improved the system.

And on cleanup:

> Yeah, absolutely. I was thinking about this too. Act early but don't clean up until it's fully finished.

What was built, in his fork:

- The watcher classifies a new status span first. A `done`, `failed`, `needs-decision`, or `blocked` closes the cycle at once, with no linger. A `working:` note keeps the linger, where coalescing still saves a turn.
- At that moment the watcher records which turn wrote the event: the T3 run that was active, or the Claude busy record's sequence on a pane backend.
  The trailing turn-end is absorbed only when that proof holds end to end: same turn, ended cleanly, no status bytes and no steer since, and the worker's current state agrees.
  Anything unproven wakes the main exactly as a bare turn-end did before.
- A run that ends failed, interrupted, or cancelled after a surfaced `done` now wakes the main once, naming the task and the status, with T3's error message when it is readable.
  Nothing reported that before.
- A finished worker's wake goes straight to the main while the captain is present, instead of through the host's engine turn; the host keeps the routine and stale wakes.
- The cycle's wait now ends on the worker's own append, on every backend, so the poll interval is the backstop rather than the latency.
- Cleanup does not act early: before closing a T3 thread, teardown waits up to 30 seconds for a still-running turn to end, and refuses rather than interrupting it, unless forced.

The evidence is the regression suites, run under Bash 3.2 on the day of landing: the watcher, T3 backend, T3 client, branch dispatcher, away daemon, and supervision host suites, with new cases for every shape the scout listed.
The live measurement against the running home was deliberately left to Firstmate after landing, so no number from a real finish is claimed here yet.
